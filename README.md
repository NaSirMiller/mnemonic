# Mnemonic - Smarter study planning.

## Who We Are

With Mnemonic we aim to simplify the academic experience with an one-stop application. More specifically, user's will be able to optimize the studying process with the help of AI.

## Features
### Course & Task Management
User's can create "courses" mimicing their schedule so they can easily organize their tasks across their different courses. Additionally, each course can have a task that needs to be completed. This can be a range of things, a homework, an exam, emailing a professor, etc. Each of these tasks can be assigned to their respective course "categories" denoting how it factors into the course's academic grade. 

A user will have many different task lists or to-do list. There is a jumbo list that factors in all courses, and course specific lists as well.

### AI
If a user would like to make their studying process more streamlined they can ask AI to help! Specifically, Mnemonic's AI can extract tasks and create courses from academic syllabi -- meaning no more manually adding course tasks to your tasks manager! Moreover, when you want to revision your to-do list you can ask Mnemonic's AI to update the tasks list such that it ranks the tasks according to factors like grade weight, due dates, and complexity.

### Other Coure Features
Mnemonic manually adds your tasks to your calendar so you can skip the tedious parts of tasks management.
